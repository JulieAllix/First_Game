# Break Free - my first game in Js

## About

I started this project because I was curious about basic videogames design. I first followed this mozilla tutorial : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript. Then I adapted the code to organize it differently, created variables enabling to design different levels quickly. And I added new functionalities : an input request to get the name of the player, 4 levels of difficulty, a connection to a database to send the score of the player and to display the top 20 scores for each level.
